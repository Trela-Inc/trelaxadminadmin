## Integration with Projects Module

The Masters Module seamlessly integrates with the Projects Module to provide:

1. **Dynamic Dropdowns**: Cities and locations populate project form dropdowns
2. **Amenity Selection**: Categorized amenity lists for project features
3. **Builder Profiles**: Pre-filled builder information in project forms
4. **Data Validation**: Ensures only valid master data is used in projects
5. **Consistency**: Single source of truth prevents data duplication

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New City
```json
POST /api/v1/masters/cities
{
  "name": "Mumbai",
  "state": "Maharashtra",
  "country": "India",
  "code": "MUM",
  "description": "Financial capital of India",
  "coordinates": [72.8777, 19.0760],
  "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
  "pinCodes": ["400001", "400002", "400003"],
  "isPopular": true,
  "sortOrder": 1
}
```

### Getting Locations for a City
```
GET /api/v1/masters/locations/city/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
```

### Filtering Amenities by Category
```
GET /api/v1/masters/amenities/category/basic
```

### Searching Builders
```
GET /api/v1/masters/builders?search=lodha&isFeatured=true&minRating=4
```

## Data Seeding

The module includes a comprehensive seeder (`masters.seeder.ts`) that populates:
- 5 major Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Delhi, Gurgaon)
- 35+ categorized amenities with icons and popularity flags
- 3 featured builders with complete profiles

To run the seeder:
```typescript
// In your application startup or migration script
const seeder = new MastersSeeder(cityModel, locationModel, amenityModel, builderModel);
await seeder.seedAll(adminUserId);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Consistency
- Always use master data IDs in projects instead of free text
- Validate foreign key relationships before creating projects
- Maintain referential integrity between cities and locations

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Cache popular master data for faster access

### 3. User Experience
- Mark popular items for quick access
- Implement search functionality across all master data
- Provide clear categorization for amenities

### 4. Data Management
- Regular cleanup of unused master data
- Monitor usage statistics to identify popular items
- Implement soft deletes to maintain data history

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Role-based access control for master data management
- Audit trail for all create/update/delete operations
- Input validation and sanitization for all fields

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Import/Export**: Excel/CSV import for master data
2. **Approval Workflow**: Multi-level approval for new master data
3. **Localization**: Multi-language support for master data
4. **API Integration**: Integration with external data sources
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Usage patterns and trends analysis
6. **Mobile App Support**: Optimized APIs for mobile applications

## Conclusion

The Masters Module provides a robust foundation for managing all configurable data in the real estate application. Its hierarchical structure, comprehensive feature set, and seamless integration with other modules make it an essential component for maintaining data consistency and providing excellent user experience.
